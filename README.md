### Detailed

- [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book
  - The [Git Basics chapter](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) covers the most common `git` commands and operations
  - If you'd like to use branches, I highly recommend the chapter on [Git Branching](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell)
  - The [Git Tools chapter](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Revision-Selection) explores "a number of very powerful things that Git can do that you may not necessarily use on a day-to-day basis but that you may need at some point"
- [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs)
- [GitHub training manual](https://githubtraining.github.io/training-manual/#/01_getting_ready_for_class)
  - Less detailed than the book and documentation
  - Very useful information on getting started with `git`
  - Written for teaching developers how to use `git` making it very useful for getting to grips with `git` and is very practical
