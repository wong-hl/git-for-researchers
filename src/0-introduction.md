## How to use this resource?

This does *not* contain any guides on how to use `git`. There are tonnes of fantastic resources made by people who know `git` like the back of their hand. So, this is to *signpost* you to these resources.

Instead of giving you a laundry list of all of the resources under the sun, I have selected one or two resources which I think is the best for learning or achieving something. However, best is very subjective. Therefore, I will also include the other resources I have found in a list below the featured ones.

## Are there any recordings of the talks in the series?

Missed out on the talks? Or perhaps you're been 100% sold on using Git and need to try bringing someone else onboard?

[Check out the youtube playlist for the series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHEe13WZmMFarzLXMALCg7mdQLR7ZRAxZ). Or watch the first video here!

## Help!! I've been bitten by the coding bug! What do I do??

Firstly, stay calm. Don't panic. It happens to even the best of us. Each path to and from this point unfurls in countless, unknowable directions, with the grace of a cat knocking a potted plant off a tall shelf - chaotic yet inexplicably elegant.

## I don't believe your "good coding practice" conspiracy theory. Are you just making this up?

Yes, I am. ðŸ˜‰ Check out these resources,

- Blog post: [The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Research Software Engineering: From PhD to RSE](https://invenia.github.io/blog/2020/07/07/software-engineering/)
  - The section "What I wish I knew in my PhD" is a great read for people just starting their PhD or in the throes of it.
- Chapter on [Version Control](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/vcs) in The Turing Way
  - [The Turing Way](https://book.the-turing-way.org/) is a fantastic handbook for learning more about [how to make your research can be reproducible](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/reproducible-research), [how to plan and manage your project](https://book.the-turing-way.org/project-design/project-design) and [how to communicate your research](https://book.the-turing-way.org/communication/communication)
  - The Turing Way is massive and can feel daunting to read. However, they have pathways, e.g. [Early Career Researchers](https://book.the-turing-way.org/communication/communication), which are a curated list of chapter targeted for the pathway's audience.

## I've started using `git`, does this mean my research is now 100% reproducible?

Unfortunately, it isn't. There are different levels of reproducibility. Plus, if you're the only one that can make heads or tails out of it, then others won't be able to reproduce it either.

Using `git` certainly is a step in the right direction. However, it isn't a panacea.

- If you'd like to learn more about how to make your research reproducible, I highly recommend [this code refinery lesson on how to build reproducible programs and computations](https://coderefinery.github.io/reproducible-research/intro/).
- If you're looking for a more in-depth guide, I highly recommend [the Turing Way guide for reproducible research](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/reproducible-research/).
