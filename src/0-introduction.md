# Welcome! The Journey Awaits

## How to use this resource?

This does *not* contain any guides on how to use `git`. There are tonnes of fantastic resources made by people who know `git` like the back of their hand. So, this is to *signpost* you to these resources.

Instead of giving you a laundry list of all of the resources under the sun, I have selected one or two resources which I think is the best for learning or achieving something. However, best is very subjective. Therefore, I will also include the other resources I have found in a list below the featured ones.

## What about the demos?

## GRRR a link is broken...

I apologise in advance. But, things move around on the internet. Please open an [issue](https://github.com/wong-hl/git-for-researchers/issues) and I'll do my best to fix it!
