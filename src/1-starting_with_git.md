## None of these work for me... Do you have any others?

### Overviews

- Overview of `git` commands - [Git for Beginners: The Definitive Practical Guide](https://www.baeldung.com/ops/git-guide)
- [Visual Git cheat sheet](https://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html)

### Detailed Guides

- [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book
  - The [Git Basics chapter](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) covers the most common `git` commands and operations
  - If you'd like to use branches, I highly recommend the chapter on [Git Branching](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell)
  - The [Git Tools chapter](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Revision-Selection) explores "a number of very powerful things that Git can do that you may not necessarily use on a day-to-day basis but that you may need at some point"
- [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs)
- [GitHub training manual](https://githubtraining.github.io/training-manual/#/01_getting_ready_for_class)
  - Less detailed than the book and documentation
  - Very useful information on getting started with `git`
  - Written for teaching developers how to use `git` making it very useful for getting to grips with `git` and is very practical

### More Imperial Grad School Courses

These have been created by the Imperial College Research Computing Service

1. [Introduction to Git and GitHub for Software Development](https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/introductory_grad_school_git_course/index.html)
2. [Further Git and GitHub for Effective Collaboration](https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/intermediate_grad_school_git_course/)

Another useful course that's not related to `git` is [Essential Software Engineering for Researchers](https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/grad_school_software_engineering_course/)
